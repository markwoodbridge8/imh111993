# inu-mo
Inu Moo is a player-driven idle farming RPG with a focus on narrative. Players level up farming skills, buy seeds from a market, and cultivate them on their farmland through idle grinding. The game's tokenomics give players control over the in-game economy and direction, drawing inspiration from titles like Runescape and Melvor Idle.
